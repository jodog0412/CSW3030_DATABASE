# CSW3030_DATABASE
It is my personal note for lecture `Introduction to database` in university.

## 1. Overview of database management
* Database system=Database management system(DBMS)+Hardware+Data+User
* Entities and Relations
  * unary relationship
  * binary relationship
  * ternary relationship
* File management system vs Database system
* Data Independence: the immunity of applications to change in storage structure and access technique

## 2. Database System Architecture
* 3-levels of data representation
  * Purpose
    * `Data Indenpendence`
    * 사용자의 view와 데이터 저장 방식에 대한 `flexibity` and `adaptability`
  * Composition 
    * `External level` view for application
    * `Conceptual level` view for integrity
    * `Internal level` view for physical storage
